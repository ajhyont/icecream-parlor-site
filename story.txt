The whole story is told as the user continues to scroll down: 
(1)the homepage starts with a bright white light which we zoom out to show the sun shining over a vanilla snow covered mountain. 
(2)The mascot comes out next, all happy and stuff, and get on top of the ice cream delivery bike that is sitting center stage. As the mascot starts peddling, the weather changes. we see the sun set, then rise again, we see vanialla snow fall, and then high winds, and all thruout the mascot continues of the bike. Finally, she reaches her destination and delivers the icecream and the cx is really happy. The background stuff all fades away as the mascot gives a thumbs up. Then, we see a red curtain fall, and then when it raises, we see a sim like view of a ice cream village where the mascot is just doing gitting in her ice cream shop doing stuff happily as other villagers go about doing their thing. All the while that this animation was happening, there was a simple navbar at the top right the user could access at any time they wanted to read the about us section of the website, contact us webpage, the locations webpage, and so on. what do u think of this vision. do u think we can make it a reality? I dont wanna do anything 3js rn  since i think 3d animations on the 1st go maybe asking 2 much of myself. so, what do u think of my idea. is it something that can b done in a reasonable amt of time? what do i need 2 bring this vision to my 4dimentional reality? b candid and provide details
